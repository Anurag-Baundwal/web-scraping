# KnowledgeScraper

This repository contains a Python script for scraping and compiling video transcripts from Real Python's Tic-Tac-Toe AI course. The script extracts the transcripts and saves them into a single Markdown file for easy access and reference.

## Motivation

The purpose of this script is to provide access to the valuable learning materials in the Tic-Tac-Toe AI course, even if the video content is behind a paywall. By compiling the transcripts, learners can still benefit from the course instructions and build the project independently.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone https://github.com/[your_username]/[repository_name].git`
2. **Install dependencies:** `pip install requests beautifulsoup4`
3. **Run the script:** `python script.py`
4. **Access the compiled transcripts:** The script will generate a file named `transcript.md` containing all the extracted transcripts.

## Disclaimer

This script is intended for educational purposes only. Please respect the intellectual property rights of Real Python and use the transcripts responsibly.
